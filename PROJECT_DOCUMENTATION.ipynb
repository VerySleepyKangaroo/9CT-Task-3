    "**Functional Requirements:**\n",
    "- The code must support importing data from common file types (eg. csv)\n",
    "- The code must detect and flag the missing values\n",
    "- The code must be able to use basic functions. This includes:\n",
    "    - Mean\n",
    "    - Median\n",
    "    - Mode\n",
    "    - frequency\n",
    "    - Range\n",
    "    - Filtering data\n",
    "    - Data visualisation\n",
    "- Comparision between columns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non Functional Requirements:**\n",
    "- The UI must be friendly, guiding users through steps like loading, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing data.\n",
    "- It should clearly label buttons and input fields\n",
    "- The system must provide visual feedback (e.g. progress indicators, success messages or error alerts).\n",
    "- Data previews must be shown using tables with scroll and search capabilities.\n",
    "- Visualization outputs should include labels and titles\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use-Case:**\n",
    "- Program Startup\n",
    "    - lorem ipsmum\n",

    "    - View Data\n",
    "    - Filter/Search Data\n",
    "    - View Visualisations\n",
    "    - Update Data\n",
    "    - Exit\n",
    "- System Response:\n",
    "    - View Data: System displays a scrollable preview of the dataset.\n",
    "    - Filter/Search: Prompts user for criteria (e.g. year, category); system displays matching results.\n",
    "    - View Visualisations: System shows graphical representations (e.g. line graph, bar chart).\n",
    "    - Update Data: User is prompted to enter the row number or unique ID and the new values. System validates and confirms update.\n",
    "    - Exit: Closes the window\n",
